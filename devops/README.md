# Devops

## Learn a Language

I've learned them from working experience and side projects.

- [x] Nodejs
- [x] Python

## Posix

- [x] standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) [READ](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/posix)

## Understand different OS concepts

- [x] I/O Management [READ](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_io_hardware.htm)
- [x] Memory/Storage [READ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)
- [x] Virtualization [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/intro/)
- [x] File Systems [READ](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm)

For virtualization I'm using Qubes OS, I highly recommend it.

- [x] Startup Management (init.d)

For this i've created a script to start the test containers of one of my work projects on startup.

Also learned about systemd and how the first process is started by the kernel.

- [x] Service Management (systemd) [READ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-systemd-and-its-components/)

Systemd works as a replacement of init.d and is used to manage services.

- [ ] Thread and concurrencys

- [x] Processes [READ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/processes-in-linuxunix/)

Types of processes:

- Foreground process: A process that is started from the command prompt and doesnâ€™t return the prompt to the user until it is completed or terminated.

- Background process: A process that runs behind the scenes. It does not require user intervention and runs as a child process of the shell.
